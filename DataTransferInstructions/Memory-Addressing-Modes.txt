###(Memory Addressing Modes)

1.The x86 instruction set supports using upto seperate component to specify a memory operand default components include
a fixed displacement value a base register an index register and a scale factor, subsequent to each instruction fetch
that specifies a memory operand the processor calculates an effective address in order to determine the final memory
address of the operand an effective address is calculated.

Effective Adddress = Base Register + Index Register * Scale Factor + Displacement

2.The base register can be any general purpose register.

3.The index register also be any general purpose register except the stack pointer register (ESP).

4.The displacement values are constant offset that are encoded within the instruction.

5.The scale factor could be 1,2,4 or 8 the size of the final effective address is always 32-Bit.

6.It is not necessary for an instruction to explicitly specify all of the components that the processor uses to calculate an
effective address.
