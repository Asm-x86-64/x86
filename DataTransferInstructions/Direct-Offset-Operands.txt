###(Direct Offset Operands)

1.We can add a displacement to the name of a Variable creating direct offset Operand.

2.This let us access memory locations that may not have explicit labels.

Example:-

    ```asm

    numArray BYTE 10h,20h,30h,40h,50h

    MOV AL, numArray ; AL = 10h
    
    MOV AL, [numArray+1] ; AL = 20h

    MOV AL, [numArray+2]; AL = 30h
    
    ```

3.If we use MOV with numArray as the source operand we automatically move the first byte in the array, such that register
AL contains just a number 10 at this stage.

4.We can access the second byte in the array by adding 1 to the offset of numArray.

5.The third byte can be accessed by adding 2 to the offset of numArray.
