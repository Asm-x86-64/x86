###(Instruction Operands)

1.Most x86 32-Bit use operands which designates these specific value.That an instruction will act upon nearly all 
instructions require one or more source operands along with a single destination operand.

2.Most instructions also require the programmer to explicitly specify the source and destination operands.

3.There are however a number of instructions where the operands are either implicitly specificed or forced by the instruction.

4.There are three basic types of operands:-

    1.Register operand
    2.Immediate operand
    3.Memory operand

Register operands are contained in a general purpose registers.

Immediate operand is a constant value encoded as part of the instruction.These are typically used to specify constant arithmetic
,logical or offset value only source operands can be used as immediate operands.

Memory operands specifies a location in memory which can contain any of the data types.An instruction can specify either the source
or destination as memory operand but cannot use both source and destination at the same time as memory operand.
