Operators and directives are not executable instructions, they are simply interpreted by the assembler.

1.OFFSET -> Returns offset of a data label
    Meaning:- The distance in byte of the label from the beginning of the data segment.

2.PTR   -> Override operand's default size. This is only neccesary when we are trying to access the variable using a
           size attribute which is different from the one used to declared a variable.

3.TYPE  -> Returns size of operand or array element size
            The type operator returns to size in byte of a single element of a variable.

4.LENGTHOF ->Returns number of elements in an array

5.SIZEOF   ->Returns number of bytes used by array initializer.

1.LABEL -> Redefines same variable with different size attributes

2.ALIGN -> Aligns a variable on a boundary.
