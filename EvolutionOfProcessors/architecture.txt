###(Von Neumann ARCHITECTURE)

1. He said a computer consists of memory, an arithmetic logic unit, a control unit and input output devices.

2. All parts of the computer are connected together by a bus.

3. The computer structure is independent of the computed problem and the computer is programmed with content of memory.


In modern computers we are able to integrate the control unit and the arithmetic logic unit into a single integrated circuit
called cpu.  


###(HARVARD ARCHITECTURE)

1. It seperated memory for data and memory for instructions.
