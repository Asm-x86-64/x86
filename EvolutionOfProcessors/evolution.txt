(x86 Processors & Computer Architecture)


(MMX) ->MultiMedia eXtension
(SSE) ->Streaming SIMD Extensions
(AVX) ->Advanced Vector Extensions


MMX -> Supports single instruction and multiple data operation or D operations for packed integers using 64-bit wide registers.

SSE -> SSE added eight 128 bit wide registers to the x86 32 bit platform and instructions that support packed single precision
floating point(32-bit floating point) arithmetic.

SSE2 ->This new Microarchitecture included SSE two, which extended the floating point capabilities of SSE to cover packed 
double precision(64-bit floating point) values.

2004 -> SSE was upgraded to SSE3 and Hyper-threading technology

AVX ->Adds packed floating point operations, both single and double precision using 256-Bit wide registers.

AVX2 ->This microarchitecture extends AVX to support packed integer operations using its 256-Bit wide registers.(FMA operations)

FMA enables software to perform successive product sum calculations using a single floating point rounding operation.
