###(x86 Flags)

A flag has two states:-

    1.Set (1)
    2.Reset/Clear (0)

There are two groups of flags in x86:-
    
    1.Control Flags
    2.Status Flags

##(Control Flags)

1.The control flags control the CPU operation, for example they can cause the CPU to break after every instruction executes.

2.They can also cause the CPU to interrupt when a arithmetic overflow is detected or make the CPU enter (virtual 86 mode) or
even (protected mode).

3.The programs can set individual bits in the flags register to control the CPU's operation Examples are the direction
and interrupt flags.

##(Status Flags)

1.The Status flags reflect the outcomes of arithmetic and logical operations performed by the CPU.They are the overflow 
design, the zero, the carry and the parity flags.

2.OVERFLOW FLAG (OF) :-> Set when the result of an signed arithmetic operations is too large to fit into the destination.

3.SIGN FLAG (SF) :-> Set when the result of an arithmetic or logical operations is negative

4.ZERO FLAG (ZF) :-> Set when the result of an arithmetic or logical operation is zero.

5.CARRY FLAG (CF) :-> Set when the result of an unsigned arithmetic operation is too large to fit into the destination.

6.PARITY FLAG (PF) :-> Set if the least-significant byte in the result contains even number of 1 bits.

7.Auxiliary CARRY (AC) :-> Set when an arithmetic operation cause a carry form bit 3 bit 4 in an 8-bit operand.
