###(8086(16-Bit) Registers)

1. All the registers in 8086 are 16-Bit

2. They are splitted into four categories:-

   1.General purpose register
   2.Index register
   3.Status and Control register
   4.Segment register

##(General purpose registers )

refer:->img/8086-general-register.jpg

        (HIGH)    (LOW)
1.AX -> AH        AL (Used as an accumulator and preferred for most operations)
2.Bx -> BH        BL (Base register, typically used to hold the address of a procedure or variable)
3.CX -> CH        CL (Uesd as a count register, typically used for looping)
4.DX -> DH        DL (Used as a data register, typically used for multiplication and division)

##(Index registers)

The index registers contain offset from a segment register for information we are interested in.

1.SI :->(Source index register and is used in copying strings)
2.DI :->(Destination index and is also used in copying strings)
3.BP :->(Base pointer register and is the offset from the SS register to locate variables on the stack)
4.SP :->(Stack pointer register and this is an offset from the SS register to the location of the stack's top)

##(Instruction Pointer)

1.IP :->(The instruction pointer register basically points to the next instruction to be executed)


##(Segment registers)

The CPU contains four segment registers used as base location for program instructions, data or the stack.

1.CS :->(Code segment register and it is the base location of program code)
2.DS :->(Data segment register is the base location for variables)
3.ES :->(Extra segment register and this is the additional base location for variables)
4.SS :->(Stack segment register is the base location for Stack)

##(Flag register)

1.Flags :-> (The flags contains the status flags of the processor)

###(x86 Registers)

conventional memory :->Real mode addresing 1MB is limited. In that 1MB, 640KB at (#00000000)bottom is conventional memory
reserved for use by DOS and its programs. the remaining 384KB is Upper memory access reserved for BIOS and peripheral drivers.

1. A register is a storage inside the processor core.

2. Can be accessed at much high speeds than conventional memory.


##(80386 (32-Bit)) or (x86 32-Bit)

refer:->img/80386-registers.gif

The general purpose registers are 32-Bit long and there are:-
      8 :-> general purpose registers
      6 :-> segment registers
      1 :-> instruction pointer register
      1 :-> status flag register
