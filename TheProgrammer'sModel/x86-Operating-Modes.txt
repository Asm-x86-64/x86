###(x86 Operating Modes)

The x86 processor has three prmiary operating modes:-

1.Protected Mode (Virtual - 8086 Mode)
2.Real Address Mode
3.System Management Mode

Protected Mode has a sub mode called virtual - 8086 Mode.


##(Protected Mode)

1. Native state of processor.
2. All instruction features are available.
3. Includes virtual-8086 sub-mode.
4. Programs are given seperate memory areas called segments
5. Processor prevents program from referencing outside their segment.

While in Protected mode, the processor can directly execute real address mode software such as Ms Dos programs in a safe,
multitasking environment. 

##(Virtual 8086 Mode)(Sub mode)

1.Allows processor to directly execute real-address mode software while in Protected mode.

##(Real-Address Mode)

1.Implements 8086 programming environment.

2.Capable of switching into other modes.

This mode can be used to run an Ms Dos program that requires direct access to the system memory and hardware devices.
Programs running in the real address mode can cause the operating system to crash.

##(System Management Mode)

1. Provide Os with System management mechanisms

The system management mode is also known as SM, and it provides a operating system with a mechanism for implementing functions
such as power management and system security.These functions are usually implemented by computer manufacturers who customize
the processor for a particular system setup.
